# Day 10

My notes on Advent of Code - Day 10: [Pipe Maze](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10)

## Part 1

The first part was quite straightforward. I basically iterate from the starting point until I complete the loop for first time.

The answer is half the length of the whole loop.

## Part 2

This is the first time **I didn't solve**. I tried to think about it on my own and had no clue how to identify if a position was inside or outside the loop.

I did some quick research and seems like counting the number of intersections with the loop (when going on any direction) should be enough.

I even thought of a solution for when you don't really cross but "touch" the loop. But I didn't implement it yet.

## Conclusion

I liked this one because I feel like a learnt a new thing. I might come back and implement it later.
