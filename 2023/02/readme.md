# Day 2

My notes on Advent of Code - Day 2: [Cube Conundrum](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)

## Part 1

My first mistake in this part was that I understood that the cubes were not introduced again into the bag.

That meant that my code, and my overall solution was completely off. I obviously didn't read the examples correctly and had a preconceived idea of what the problem was asking.

My second mistake was that I understood we were looking for the _impossible_ solutions, not for the _possible_ solutions.

Again, no excuses. I should have paid more attention :)

Also initially the code was overcomplicated because I was anticipating the second part of the problem. Which was a mistake.

## Part 2

The second part was much more easy. I was anticipating something completely different (more complex) so it was a surprise.

This time I tested with the example input and made sure I read the problem correctly.

Easy peasy.

## Conclusion

Aarón, can you just read and chill a bit? Please? Thank you.
