# Day 9

My notes on Advent of Code - Day 9: [Mirage Maintenance](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9)

## Part 1

The problem was easy to understand but I got too conscious about naming and struggled to even understand my initial code. No coffee yet, so maybe that's part of the problem.

Once the code was clear I saw that I didn't need to do exactly the same as the example. I just added the last element on all sub-sequences and it worked.

## Part 2

In this part by simple "sum everything" didn't work. I invested some time trying to not-do what the example did exactly. But after a while I just replicated the same behavior and it worked.

I don't like the code and I getting quite messy with naming in these last days. If I used more functions (or even classes) it should be easier to understand.


## Conclusion

Simple problem that leads to ugly code. Interesting thought.
