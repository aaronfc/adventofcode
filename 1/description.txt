--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---

   Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been
   selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it,
   they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to
   be having problems.

   You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow
   operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.

   Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on
   each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
   complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

   You try to ask why they can't just use a [14]weather machine ("not
   powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and
   why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and
   hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow
   comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you
   into a [15]trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").

   As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their
   calibration document (your puzzle input) has been amended by a very
   young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills.
   Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the
   document.

   The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each
   line originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves
   now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found
   by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form
   a single two-digit number.

   For example:
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

   In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38,
   15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

   Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of
   the calibration values?
